# Interim Engineering Decisions (MVP Unblock)

**These are not Product-final decisions.** They exist so MVP implementation and tests can proceed while producer / data specs are incomplete.

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Status label | **Interim** — never write as **Resolved** product truth |
| Supersede | When Product or the format/data spec answers the linked Q*, update that Q to Resolved/Proposed, delete or strike the row here, and fix dependent specs in the **same PR** |
| Tests | Assert interim behavior; titles may note `(interim)` |
| Code comments | Prefer linking this file / Q id over inventing silent TBDs |

Canonical Product answers stay in [OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](OPEN_QUESTIONS.md). Packaging proposals that Product has not confirmed: [PACKAGING_SUGGESTIONS.md](PACKAGING_SUGGESTIONS.md) (also interim until accepted).

## Interim table (MVP)

| ID | Topic | Interim decision | Implement / test as | Superseded when |
|----|-------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **I-Q2** | `.ncrep` vs `.rep` | **Same binary layout and magic**; treat as product aliases for one parser | One `RepAdapter`; both extensions open Timeline | Product defines divergence (version field, required embeds) |
| **I-Q4** | Golden fixture | Primary CI fixture = [`data/out.rep`](../../data/out.rep) (flat AIV). Acceptance = parse + render + hide rules — **not** sketch pixel-parity. Playground stress `small`/`medium`/`large` emit nested Card → Core → pipe `SwimlaneModel` for sketch hierarchy | e2e `PR-E2E-001` on `out.rep`; stress unit tests for Card tree | Sketch-faithful production golden arrives (Product Q4 target) |
| **I-Q6a** | Summary tiles | Show **confirmed** duration from `OpBasicInfo.csv` `Task Duration(us)`. **Hide** compute TFLOPS and avg core util tiles. Duration uses sketch card chrome (bar still I-Q6e). Op type is **not** a separate card. I/O BW → **I-Q6g** | Thin duration card in `StatsAside` | Data/format spec defines compute / avg-util formulas (Q6) |
| **I-Q6b** | PIPE aggregation | **Mean of non-`NA` ratios** per pipe family across `block_id` | `PipeOccupancyPanel` unit tests | Q6 / data spec overrides aggregation |
| **I-Q6c** | Block scope vs aggregate | Summary **PIPE bars** stay I-Q6b (mean across blocks). **Detail / memory / metrics** views are **block-scoped** via the block switcher ([`v930/memory-load-detail`](../ui/source/v930/memory-load-detail.jpeg)). Default selected block = first `block_id` in fixture order | Aside detail tabs + block picker tests | Product defines block vs aggregate UX |
| **I-Q6d** | 查看全部 CSV | Library emits `view-full-csv` with `{ fileName, text }` (or blob URL). Playground / MSTT host opens the full CSV in a **new tab** (blob URL or editor tab) | Emit + host/playground open | Product specifies host chrome |
| **I-Q6e** | Duration card chrome | Progress bar is **decorative** (fixed short cyan fill), not a % of peak. Secondary: `blockDim` → iterations/core label; else `opName`; else omit | `PR-STATS-009`–`011` | Product defines duration-bar scale and secondary formula |
| **I-Q6f** | PIPE in-bar absolute | `absoluteValue` = **mean of non-`NA` `*_time(us)`** for the same family/side as the ratio (I-Q6b). Omit when all NA. No cycles→display inventing | `PR-STATS-013`, adapter unit tests | Product defines in-bar metric |
| **I-Q6g** | I/O bandwidth cards | **Measured (confirmed):** mean of non-`NA` `aic_main_mem_{read\|write}_bw(GB/s)` / `aiv_*` on `Memory.csv` (first matching header only; also accept headers without `(GB/s)`). **Peak (still guess):** **1600 GB/s** (sketch 1.6 TB/s) for all four aic/aiv × in/out slots — **not** max of measured columns. **Score (still guess):** `round(measured/peak×100)` clamped 0–100 (sketch dummy 81 ≠ ratio). **Bar:** fill = score % of track. **Display:** TB/s = GB/s÷1000, magnitude rounding. **Layout:** same card chrome as duration; aic \| aiv columns; cards stack full-width. **NA side:** omit that aic/aiv column; omit card if both NA. `Report.csv` unused (no schema). | `bandwidthCards`, `PR-VM-013`, `PR-STATS-024` | Product peak source, score formula vs sketch 81, aggregation, `Report.csv`, **GB/s vs TB/s** when measured ≪ 1 TB/s |
| **I-Q5+** | Overview series | Adapter returns `overviewSeries: []`; UI **hides** charts (aligns with Product Q5) | No fake series from CSV | Producer defines `OverviewSeries` source |
| **I-Q11a** | Roofline Y (TOps/s) | Achieved performance = mean non-`NA` `aiv_vec_fops` / mean non-`NA` `aiv_time(us)` as `fops / timeUs / 1e6` (Cube: `aic_cube_fops` / `aic_time(us)` when Vector fops absent). Aggregate across blocks like I-Q6b | `RooflinePanel` / adapter tests | Product Q11 formulas |
| **I-Q11b** | Roofline X GM (Ops/Byte) | Intensity = same fops / `(mean(read_main_memory_datas(KB)) + mean(write_main_memory_datas(KB))) * 1024` from `Memory.csv` | Adapter GM point | Product Q11 |
| **I-Q11c** | Roofline L2 series | **Omit** L2 point (L2Cache has hit counts only, no byte traffic) | Legend GM-only when L2 absent | Product supplies L2 bytes |
| **I-Q11d** | Roofline roof | `peakComputeTops = 1`; `peakBandwidthGBs` = max of non-`NA` `aiv_main_mem_*_bw(GB/s)` / `aic_main_mem_*_bw(GB/s)` (fallback **100** if all NA). Roof TOps/s = `min(peakCompute, peakBW_GBs * intensity / 1000)` | Chart roof polyline | Product peak sources |
| **I-Q11e** | Roofline op-mix | Normalize non-zero Vector `aiv_vec_{fp32,fp16,int32,int16,misc}_ratio` (or Cube `aic_cube_*`) to %; show top contributors | Mix labels on chart | Product mix definition |
| **I-Q11f** | Roofline tabs | **Hide** 内存单元 / 通路 / 搬运 until Q11 defines distinct series | Single chart chrome | Product tab semantics |
| **I-Q9** | Dependency encoding | Chrome Trace `args` convention: `args.event_id` makes an X event addressable (else the adapter's own `e-<seq>` id stands) and `args.dependencies` lists **successor** ids. Predecessors come from a reverse index, never from the producer. Ids that no event carries are dropped. `dependencies` capability + every dependency surface hide when the model has no edges | `buildDependencyGraph` / `neighborsOf` (`PR-DEPGRAPH-*`), `DetailRelevant` (`PR-DREL-*`), playground `deps` fixture | Product defines the real producer encoding (Q9) |
| **I-Q7a** | Hardware details panel | **Source confirmed:** `HardwareInfo.jsonl` category sections. Fallback: flat **OpBasicInfo** non-empty columns when jsonl absent. Never invent cores/HBM/peaks. Omit model when both absent | `HardwareDetailsPanel`, adapter tests | Product maps 核数 / NPU ARCH onto the meta row |
| **I-Q14** | Time display | **Time (auto)** vs **CPU clocks**. Time mode auto-scales s/ms/µs/ns (viewport from visible span; overview from total span×width). Clocks: `cycles = ns × freqMHz / 1000` with `freqMHz = currentFreq ?? ratedFreq` from `OpBasicInfo` (MHz); prefer **Current Freq** over Rated when they differ. Hide clocks option when freq missing; fall back to time if freq disappears while in cycles. **Not** per-event `*_total_cycles`; display conversion only (see note below) | Formatter + toolbar mode + host `timeDisplayMode` prop | Product answers **Q23** / **HQ 38** (true vs derived cycles) and/or refines freq/labels |
| **I-Q16–19** | Packaging / UX chrome | Follow [PACKAGING_SUGGESTIONS.md](PACKAGING_SUGGESTIONS.md) as if accepted for scaffold | Repo-root `src/`, Ant Design + custom swimlane CSS, zh-CN default + EN keys, wheel/slider MVP gestures | Product confirm/change each Q16–Q19 |

### I-Q14 — CPU clocks from OpBasicInfo freq

**Formula.** `cycles = ns × freqMHz / 1000`, where `freqMHz` is `SummaryMetrics.currentFreq` if set, else `ratedFreq` (both from `OpBasicInfo.csv` `Current Freq` / `Rated Freq`). Values are treated as **MHz** (AI Core clock; matches aside **aic频率**).

**Why Current Freq.** Prefer current over rated when they differ (DVFS / measured operating clock). On [`data/out.rep`](../../data/out.rep), `PipeUtilization` `aiv_total_cycles / aiv_time(us)` equals OpBasicInfo `Current Freq` (1650) per block — display conversion matches measured block cycles for that pack.

**Caveats (interim).**

- Product questions: [OPEN Q23](OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) / [HQ 38](HQ_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md). Interim choice **A** — derived labels via this formula; options B/C in those ledgers.
- Cycles mode is **derived** from timeline ns and freq, not a pass-through of `aic_total_cycles` / `aiv_total_cycles` per swimlane event.
- Assumes swimlane timestamps share the same AIC clock domain as OpBasicInfo freq; markers on other clocks would be mislabeled.
- Do **not** use `HardwareInfo.jsonl` `ai_core_frequency_MHZ` for this conversion (sample values can disagree with OpBasicInfo; e.g. doc example `[100,100]` vs `1650` on `out.rep`).
- When freq is missing or invalid, hide the clocks option and show `—` in cycles formatters (no invented freq).

## MVP scope under interims (checklist)

Allowed to implement now:

1. Tooling scaffold (Vitest, Playwright, playground)
2. `.rep` / `.ncrep` parse (alias) + Chrome Trace → `SwimlaneModel`
3. Standalone Chrome Trace `.json` open path
4. Timeline shell, axis, gutter, swimlane, tooltip, select → detail
5. PIPE bars when `PipeUtilization` present
6. Thin summary (name / type / duration only)
7. Hide overview, undecidable summary tiles, missing panels

Not required for first MVP merge:

- Sketch-faithful multi-core golden
- Full report stats tiles (compute / avg util) — I/O BW shipped under I-Q6g
- Overview charts with real series
- Product-final hardware inventory beyond I-Q7a; roofline tabs / L2 series beyond I-Q11*; memory SVG; deps; secondary tabs
