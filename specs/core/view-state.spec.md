# View State

Pure functions managing swimlane viewport — zoom, pan, window boundaries, zoom-to-fit. All return new objects; none mutate inputs.

```ts
createViewState(model: SwimlaneModel | null | undefined): SwimlaneViewState
setSelectedEvent(state: SwimlaneViewState, eventId: string | null): SwimlaneViewState
setMultiSelection(state: SwimlaneViewState, eventIds: string[]): SwimlaneViewState
clearSelection(state: SwimlaneViewState): SwimlaneViewState
zoomAt(view: SwimlaneViewWindow, factor: number, anchorTime: number, bounds?: Bounds): SwimlaneViewWindow
panBy(view: SwimlaneViewWindow, deltaTime: number, bounds?: Bounds): SwimlaneViewWindow
zoomToFitWindow(model: SwimlaneModel | null | undefined): SwimlaneViewWindow
applyWindow(state: SwimlaneViewState, window: SwimlaneViewWindow): SwimlaneViewState
measureFocusWindow(range: MeasureRange, bounds: Bounds, scrollY?: number): SwimlaneViewWindow
zoomPercentFromSpan(span: number, fullSpan: number): number
spanFromZoomPercent(pct: number, fullSpan: number): number
```

## Behavior

**Immutability.** All functions return new objects. The parent ProfilingReport uses `{ ...viewState.value, ...patch }` to trigger Vue reactivity — mutating in place would prevent the deep watcher in SwimlaneCanvas from detecting changes.

**Initialization.** `createViewState` initializes from a SwimlaneModel, defaulting to zoom-to-fit with zero scroll, no selection/hover, empty `multiSelectedIds`, empty search, aside visible, no playhead, `measureMode: false`, `measureRange: null`.

**Selection exclusivity.** Single-select (`selectedEventId`) and marquee multi-select (`multiSelectedIds`) are mutually exclusive — only one dock mounts. `setSelectedEvent` and `setMultiSelection` each clear the other side, so callers never have to remember to; `clearSelection` drops both (empty-space click, Escape, empty marquee commit). `setMultiSelection` copies the id array, so a caller's later mutation cannot reach state.

**Measure (M2).** `setMeasureMode` / `setMeasureRange` / `clearMeasure` update measure fields immutably. Range endpoints are order-normalized (`startTime <= endTime`, ns units matching the viewport). Clearing / disabling measure nulls the range. Local overlay only — does not drive aside recompute. `measureFocusWindow` centers a measured range so it spans half the visible width (25% padding each side), clamps to bounds, and fits the full bounds when 2× duration exceeds the trace.

**Zoom.** `zoomAt` zooms around an anchor time point. Factor >1 zooms in, <1 zooms out. Span is clamped to a minimum of 1 (`MIN_WINDOW`). With bounds, the zoomed window never exceeds the bounds edges — if the zoomed span exceeds the full bounds, returns the full bounds.

**Shared zoom range (toolbar slider).** `zoomPercentFromSpan` / `spanFromZoomPercent` map the same extremes as wheel/`zoomAt`: slider 0 = fit (`fullSpan`), slider 100 = `MIN_WINDOW`. Log2 interpolate with `maxRatio = fullSpan / MIN_WINDOW` (not a hard 100× cap).

**Pan.** `panBy` shifts the viewport by delta time units. Positive delta moves later times into view. With bounds, the window is clamped to stay within bounds edges.

**Zoom-to-fit.** `zoomToFitWindow` spans `[model.minTime, model.maxTime]` (data span). Display labels use `minTime` as origin so the left edge reads `0`, matching PyPTO / Perfetto Timecode defaults.

**Bounds protection.** The caller adds a +1 guard when `maxTime === minTime` to prevent division by zero during zoom calculations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **PR-VIEW-001** — zoomToFitWindow covers model minTime through maxTime.
2. **PR-VIEW-002** — zoomAt shrinks around anchor.
3. **PR-VIEW-003** — panBy shifts within bounds.
4. **PR-VIEW-004** — createViewState initializes measure off.
5. **PR-VIEW-005** — setMeasureRange normalizes; clearMeasure resets.
6. **PR-VIEW-006** — measureFocusWindow centers at half span.
7. **PR-VIEW-007** — measureFocusWindow clamps / fits when 2× exceeds.
8. **PR-VIEW-008** — zoomPercent extremes: 0 ↔ full, 100 ↔ MIN_VIEW_WINDOW.
9. **PR-VIEW-009** — zoomPercent ↔ span round-trip.
10. **PR-VIEW-010** — slider max matches zoomAt floor.
11. **PR-VIEW-011** — zoomToFitWindow for `minTime === maxTime` uses `[minTime, minTime + MIN_WINDOW]` (aligned with bounds).
12. **PR-VIEW-012** — single/multi select are exclusive; clearSelection drops both.

## Edge Cases

- null/undefined model → zoomToFitWindow returns {startTime:0, endTime:1, scrollY:0}.
- Degenerate `minTime === maxTime` → zoomToFitWindow returns `{startTime: minTime, endTime: minTime + MIN_WINDOW}` (aligned with ProfilingReport bounds `minTime + 1`).
- Zoom factor ≤0 → span clamped to MIN_WINDOW=1.
- Pan beyond bounds → clamped to edges.

## Changelog
- **2026-08-25** — `multiSelectedIds` + exclusivity helpers for marquee multi-select (PR-VIEW-012).
- **2026-08-25** — Degenerate minTime===maxTime fit stays in minTime space (PR-VIEW-011).
- **2026-08-25** — zoomToFit restored to `[minTime, maxTime]`; display origin is minTime (PyPTO/Perfetto default).
- **2026-08-24** — zoomToFit starts at producer t=0 (events align with absolute axis/tooltip).
- **2026-08-21** — Shared zoomPercent ↔ span helpers; slider 100 = MIN_WINDOW (PR-VIEW-008…010).
- **2026-08-21** — Document measureFocusWindow; PR-VIEW-006/007.
- **2026-08-07** — Note M2 measure as planned; no AC until coded.
- **2026-08-05** — Initial spec. Core behaviors established.
