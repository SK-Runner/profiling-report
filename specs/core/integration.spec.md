# Integration & E2E Tests

|----------------|
| PR-UI-*, PR-E2E-* |

Outside-in tests verifying the full component tree and playground render correctly. These test composition — per-component units are tested in their own folders.

## Behavior

**Integration (Vitest + Vue Test Utils).** Mounts ProfilingReport with `data/out.rep` source and exercises the full component tree through prop updates and DOM queries. Verifies that loading produces visible chrome, interactions propagate state, the aside renders when data is available and hides for standalone CTEF, zoom-to-fit expands to full timeline, search filters events, and the overview brush updates the viewport.

**E2E (Playwright against playground).** Loads the playground with `data/out.rep` and verifies real browser rendering: timeline visible, hover shows tooltip, click selects event and shows detail strip, zoom-to-fit via toolbar, standalone JSON opens without aside, overview brush updates window and cursor. `?fixture=ffn_dense&renderer=webgl` compiles the WebGL curve shaders and paints selected dependency curves (jsdom never acquires `webgl2`).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Integration (PR-UI)

1. **PR-UI-001**: Mounts ProfilingReport with fixture source, shows timeline chrome.
1. **PR-UI-002**: Select emits detail payload with event name, startTime, and duration.
1. **PR-UI-003**: Aside renders summary stats and pipe occupancy when CSV data available.
1. **PR-UI-004**: Zoom-to-fit expands viewport to full timeline.
1. **PR-UI-005**: Search input filters events in swimlane.
1. **PR-UI-006**: Standalone CTEF renders timeline without aside panel.
1. **PR-UI-007**: Time overview brush emits window update events.
1. **PR-UI-008**: CSV-only report (compute/memory tables, no summary/pipe) auto-opens aside and shows toggle.

### E2E (PR-E2E)

1. **PR-E2E-001**: Playground loads `data/out.rep` and renders timeline.
1. **PR-E2E-002**: Hover over swimlane event shows tooltip.
1. **PR-E2E-003**: Click event selects it, detail strip shows name and times.
1. **PR-E2E-004**: Zoom-to-fit via toolbar renders full timeline span.
1. **PR-E2E-005**: Standalone JSON opens without CSV aside.
1. **PR-E2E-006**: Overview brush updates time window and cursor line.
1. **PR-E2E-007**: `?fixture=ffn_dense&renderer=webgl` attaches WebGL, paints selected dependency curves, and search does not rebuild the cached graph.
1. **PR-E2E-008**: Active measure toggle has `aria-pressed="true"` and open-stroke Δt arrowheads (`fill="none"`); geometry covered by `PR-TOOLBAR-007c`.
1. **PR-E2E-009**: Relevent connector curves meet their chips flush, at any name length.
1. **PR-E2E-010**: Dragging the dock taller grows its columns with it.
1. **PR-E2E-011**: Drag marquees real events into the multi-select dock; bars fill against the widest row; a Name click hands off to DetailPanel.
1. **PR-E2E-012**: Escape cancels a marquee mid-drag and clears a committed one.

## Dependencies

[UX_SPEC.md](../../docs/ui/UX_SPEC.md) (scenarios S1–S3), [INTERACTIONS.md](../../docs/ui/INTERACTIONS.md).

## Changelog
- **2026-08-25** — PR-E2E-011/012: marquee multi-select in Chromium. Only a real browser has the gutter resize handle overlapping the canvas's left edge and a layout engine that sizes the inline bars, so jsdom cannot catch either.
- **2026-08-20** — PR-E2E-008 structural (no pixel crop diff); defers icon geometry to PR-TOOLBAR-007c.
- **2026-08-20** — PR-E2E-009: chip-to-curve join measured in a real layout engine. Chips are content-sized in jsdom too, so only a browser can catch a short name sitting ~28px short of its connector.
- **2026-08-19** — PR-E2E-007: Chromium WebGL dependency curves (`ffn_dense`).
- **2026-08-12** — PR-E2E-008 measure toggle icon vs design crop.
- **2026-08-05** — Initial spec. Core behaviors established.
